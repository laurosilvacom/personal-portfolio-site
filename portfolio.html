          This project assessed the following skills. Reading tests, using git
          to maintain code, manipulating and processing data in lists and
          strings, and practicing pair-programming techniques. An anagram is a
          word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word
          or phrase. In this project my partner and I created Adagrams, a game
          in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an
          anagram using those letters. Each submitted word will score points.

          This project assessed the following skills. Reading, writing, and
          using tests. Demonstrating understanding of the client-server model,
          request-response cycle and conventional RESTful routes. Driving
          development with independent research, experimentation, and
          collaboration. Reading and using existing external web APIs. Using
          Postman as part of the development workflow. Using git as part of the
          development workflow. Working with the Flask package I was able to
          create the following. Create models, conventional RESTful CRUD routes
          for a model, read query parameters to create custom behavior, and
          create unconventional routes for custom behavior. I applied my
          knowledge about making requests in Python, to call an API inside of an
          API. I applied my knowledge about environment variables and created a
          one-to-many relationship between two models.
