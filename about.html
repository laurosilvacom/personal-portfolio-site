            I am a part of Ada Developers Academy Tigers class. Prior to joining
            Ada, I was a Registered Nurse (RN) but after working through the
            pandemic I was burnt out and looking for another career path. My
            brother who is a software developer encouraged me to look into the
            tech industry and after creating my first landing page I was in love
            with how much I could create with some basic HTML and CSS. My
            passion for coding grew when I learned Python and was able to flex
            my problem solving skills. Despite my brothers support, I never
            believed I could break into the tech industry AND be successful
            until I learned about Ada. I was surprised to find a program that
            not only gives you the technical skills but also has an emphasis on
            preparing you to be successful in the tech industry while making the
            industry more diverse and anti-racist. My goal is to land a remote
            developer job after graduation and one day be experienced enough to
            volunteer at Ada and give back. I am also passionate about baking,
            painting, my two fur babies Harper and Scooby, Legos, The Office,
            and books!
